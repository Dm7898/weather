# 🌤️ Weather App

A simple weather application built with **React**, using **Styled Components** for styling. The app allows users to search for a city and view current weather conditions, including forecasts.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search for a city** and get real-time weather updates.
- 🌡️ **Current weather information** (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition).
- 📅 **5-day weather forecast**.
- 🎨 **Styled Components** for modern and responsive UI.

## Approach

- Firstly I went to the weathermap api website first, signed in, and then took down the api key information
- After creating a spearte component according to the assignment requirements
- I created a weathercontext api to access the available values for the city and toggleunit in Golbal State
- I then installed React Tanstack query and styled components for styling and query fetching
- Finally, I created a separate file for each of the components
- # I completed funtionality according to requirement.At the end applied styles

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
